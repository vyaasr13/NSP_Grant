% Defining the slow oscillation phase bins

winsize = 2*pi/numbin; % getting bin width
for j=1:numbin

end

% Phase-locking value calculation for each phase bin
plv = zeros(numbin,1);
for j=1:numbin % looping through the phase bins
    I = find(slow_phase <  position(j)+winsize & slow_phase >=  position(j)); % selecting the phase time-series of the jth bin
    plv(j) = abs(sum(exp(1i*(fast_phase1(I) - fast_phase2(I))))/length(I)); % calculating the PLV in the jth bin

% Getting the modulation index for the PLV
plv_norm = plv./sum(plv); % normalizing the PLV by the sum across bins
Hmax = log(numbin); % maximum entropy
